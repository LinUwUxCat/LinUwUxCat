Heya! I'm LinuxCat, an 18yo student at IUT Informatique in Nantes, France!\
In university, I'm learning quite a lot of languages, including:
- Golang
- Kotlin
- SQL
- HTML+CSS
- PHP
- Python

In addition to that, I also learned some languages such as C, C++ and C# myself!\
You can explore some of my personal work in the below repositories - thanks for reading!
